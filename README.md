Natural Language Processing ,which is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language or which refers to the application of neural network models to understand, interpret, and generate human-like language.

Applications of NLP are diverse and span various domains. Some key areas of NLP applications include:

1)Text understanding and analysis: 
which comprises sentiment analysis ,named entity recognition(NER) and text summarization,topic modeling 
2)Speech Recognition 
3)Language Translation
4)Information Retrieval 
5)Chatbots and Conversational Agents 

NLP has wide range of applications in Health Care and Finance,Legal,Retail ,E-commerce,Education,Human Resources,Security,Government.

NLP using NN involves the following key components:
1)Word Embeddings 
2)Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
3)Transformer Architecture 
4)Sequence-to-Sequence Models 
5)BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
